    "Welcome to Data Science and Health! In this class, we will be exploring some of the fundamentals of data science and apply them to various health and healthcare datasets. As you will see in this course, there are many potential applications of data science techniques in healthcare. However, one of the many difficulties of fully realizing the potential of these techniques is access to data. The main privacy law surrounding health care data is known as HIPAA or the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996. "

    "MIMIC-III (‘Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care’), according to [the MIMIC publication](https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201635), is a large, single-center database comprising information relating to patients admitted to critical care units at a large tertiary care hospital. Data includes vital signs, medications, laboratory measurements, observations and notes charted by care providers, fluid balance, procedure codes, diagnostic codes, imaging reports, hospital length of stay, survival data, and more. The database supports applications including academic and industrial research, quality improvement initiatives, and higher education coursework."
